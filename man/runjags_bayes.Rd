\title{Run JAGS on a formatted data ply}
\usage{
runjags_bayes(data_list, model_path, params_out, split_dates,
  keep_mcmc = FALSE, n_chains = 4, adapt_steps = 1000,
  burnin_steps = 4000, saved_steps = 40000, thin_steps = 1,
  verbose = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_list}{a formatted list of inputs to the JAGS model}

\item{model_path}{the JAGS model file to use, as a full file path}

\item{params_out}{a character vector of parameters whose values in the MCMC 
runs should be recorded and summarized}

\item{keep_mcmc}{logical. If TRUE, the Jags or Stan output object will be 
saved. Be careful; these can be big, and a run with many models might 
overwhelm R's memory.}

\item{n_chains}{the number of chains to run}

\item{adapt_steps}{the number of steps per chain to use in adapting the model}

\item{burnin_steps}{the number of steps per chain to run and ignore before
starting to collect MCMC 'data'}

\item{saved_steps}{the number of MCMC steps per chain to save}

\item{thin_steps}{the number of steps to move before saving another step. 1
means save all steps.}

\item{verbose}{logical. give status messages?}

\item{...}{args passed to other runxx_bayes functions but ignored here}
}
\description{
Seems to need to import rjags but does not, for now, because I can't get 
rjags to install on the Condor cluster. Including an import rjags line here 
allowed runjags to do its job last time I tried.
