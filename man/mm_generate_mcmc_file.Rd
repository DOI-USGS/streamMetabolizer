}
\arguments{
\item{type}{the model type, corresponding to the model fitting function 
(\code{\link{metab_bayes}}, \code{\link{metab_mle}}, etc.)}

\item{pool_K600}{Should the model pool information among days to get more 
consistent daily estimates for K600? Options: \code{'none'}=no pooling of 
K600; \code{'normal'}=\eqn{K600 ~ N(mu, sigma)}; \code{'linear'}=\eqn{K600 
~ N(B[0] + B[1]*Q, sigma)}; \code{'binned'}=\eqn{K600 ~ N(B[Q_bin], sigma)}
where \eqn{mu ~ N(mu_mu, mu_sigma)} and \eqn{sigma ~ N(sigma_mu, 
sigma_sigma)}. See Details for more.}

\item{err_obs_iid}{logical. Should IID observation error be included? If not,
the model will be fit to the differences in successive DO measurements, 
rather than to the DO measurements themselves.}

\item{err_proc_acor}{logical. Should autocorrelated process error (with the 
autocorrelation term phi fitted) be included?}

\item{err_proc_iid}{logical. Should IID process error be included?}

\item{ode_method}{The method to use in solving the ordinary differential 
equation for DO. euler=Euler: the final change in DO from t=1 to t=2 is
solely a function of GPP, ER, DO, etc. at t=1. trapezoid=pairmeans: the
final change in DO from t=1 to t=2 is a function of the mean values of GPP,
ER, etc. across t=1 and t=2. With metab_mle, other methods are available
including 'rk2' and any character method accepted by
\code{\link[deSolve]{ode}} in the \code{deSolve} package}

\item{GPP_fun}{How to partition daily GPP over time. \code{linlight}: GPP is 
a linear function of light with an intercept at 0. \code{satlight} GPP is a
saturating function of light.}

\item{ER_fun}{How to partition daily ER over time. \code{constant}: ER is 
constant over every timestep of the day. \code{q10temp} (not yet 
implemented): ER at each timestep is a function of the water temperature.}

\item{deficit_src}{From what DO estimate (observed or modeled) should the DO 
deficit be computed?}

\item{engine}{Which software are we generating code for?}
