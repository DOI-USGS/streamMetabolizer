\title{Validate one day of data, returning a vector of error strings if needed}
\usage{
mm_is_valid_day(data_ply, day_start = 4, day_end = 27.99,
  day_tests = c("full_day", "even_timesteps", "complete_data"),
  ply_date = as.Date(format(data_ply[nrow(data_ply)/2, "solar.time"],
  "\%Y-\%m-\%d")), timestep_days = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_ply}{a data.frame containing all relevant, validated modeling data
for a single ply of data. (1 ply ~= 1 date, although the day length has 
been specified by day_start and day_end and may not be exactly 24 hours)}

\item{day_start}{start time (inclusive) of a day's data in number of hours 
from the midnight that begins the date. For example, day_start=-1.5 
indicates that data describing 2006-06-26 begin at 2006-06-25 22:30, or at 
the first observation time that occurs after that time if day_start doesn't
fall exactly on an observation time.}

\item{day_end}{end time (exclusive) of a day's data in number of hours from 
the midnight that begins the date. For example, day_end=30 indicates that 
data describing 2006-06-26 end at the last observation time that occurs 
before 2006-06-27 06:00.}

\item{day_tests}{list of tests to conduct to determine whether each date
worth of data is valid for modeling}

\item{ply_date}{the Date this data_ply is intended to match. May be NA}

\item{timestep_days}{the expected timestep length in fraction of a day; for 
example, a 1-hour timestep is 1/24 is 0.0416667. This is calculated within 
the function if timestep_days is NA. May be supplied as an argument to (1) 
pre-calculate the value for efficiency, or (2) require a specific timestep.}
}
\value{
character vector of errors if day is invalid, or TRUE if it's valid
}
\description{
Provides ability to skip a poorly-formatted day for calculating metabolism, 
without breaking the whole loop. Rather than producing errors, quietly 
collects problems/errors as a list of strings for the calling function to 
handle.
}
\details{
Assumes that the data have already been validated as in 
\code{\link{mm_validate_data}}
}
