\title{Use USGS API (USGS Elevation Point Query Service) to determine approximate 
local elevation}
\usage{
lookup_usgs_elevation(latitude, longitude, units = c("Meters", "Feet"))
}
\arguments{
\item{latitude}{degrees latitude (positive for north) of the location to look
up.}

\item{longitude}{degrees longitude (positive for east) of the location to 
look up.}

\description{
This is meant to supply an APPROXIMATE elevation, with no guarantees on 
precision or on the lifetime of the API service used by the function. This 
function uses two packages, \code{RCurl} and \code{XML}, that are not 
required for the \code{streamMetabolizer} package as a whole. If these are 
not already installed, run \code{install.packages(c('RCurl','XML'))} before 
calling \code{lookup_usgs_elevation}.
