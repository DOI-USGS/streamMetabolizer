\usage{
prepdata_bayes(data, data_daily, ply_date = NA, specs, engine, model_name,
  priors = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame of input data at the temporal resolution of raw 
observations (unit-value). Columns must have the same names, units, and 
format as the default. See the \strong{'Formatting \code{data}'} section 
below for a full description.}

\item{data_daily}{data.frame containing inputs with a daily timestep. See the
\strong{'Formatting \code{data_daily}'} section below for a full 
description.}

\item{ply_date}{the modal date of this ply of data and data_daily, and the 
date by which this ply should be referred topresent.}

\item{specs}{a list of model specifications and parameters for a model. 
Although this may be specified manually (it's just a list), it is easier
and safer to use \code{\link{specs}} to generate the list, because the set
of required parameters and their defaults depends on the model given in the
\code{model_name} argument to \code{specs}. The help file for 
\code{\link{specs}} lists the necessary parameters, describes them in 
detail, and gives default values.}

\item{engine}{The software or function to use in fitting the model. Should be
specified via \code{mm_name} rather than here. For type='bayes', one of 
\code{c('jags','stan')} indicating the software package to use for the MCMC
process. For type='Kmodel', the name of an interpolation or regression 
method relating K to the predictor[s] of choice. One of \code{c("mean", 
"lm", "loess")}. For types in \code{c('mle','night','sim')} there's only 
one option so it's not included in \code{specs()} (but is nonetheless noted
in the suffix of the model name, e.g., \code{"m_np_oi_pm_km.nlm"} uses 
\code{nlm()} for model fitting)}

\item{model_name}{character string identifying the model features. Use 
\code{\link{mm_name}} for valid names. This may be a full model file path 
for custom Bayesian models, as long as basename(model_name) can still be 
parsed correctly with \code{mm_parse_name()}. In that case the file may be 
specified either as a file path relative to the streamMetabolizer models 
directory (the first assumption; this directory can be found with 
\code{system.file("models", package="streamMetabolizer")}) or as an 
absolute path or a path relative to the current working directory (the 
second assumption, if the first assumption turns up no files of the given 
name).}

\item{priors}{logical. Should the data list be modified such that JAGS will 
return priors rather than posteriors?}
}
\value{
list of data for input to runjags_bayes or runstan_bayes
}
\description{
This function accepts exactly one day's worth of data, (one ply, which might 
be 24 hrs or 31.5 or so), which should already be validated. It prepares the 
data needed to run a Bayesian MCMC method to estimate GPP, ER, and K600.
