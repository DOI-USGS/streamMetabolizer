\title{Plot predictions produced with predict_DO}
\usage{
plot_metab_preds(metab_preds, y_var = c("GPP", "ER", "K600"),
  style = c("ggplot2"), y_lim = list(GPP = c(NA, NA), ER = c(NA, NA), K600 =
  c(NA, NA)))
}
\arguments{
\item{metab_preds}{a data.frame of predictions such as that returned by 
predict_metab()}

\item{y_var}{character. Should the plot display predicted values of GPP, ER, 
and/or K600? The default is to plot all three.}

\item{style}{character indicating which graphics package to use}

\item{y_lim}{list of named vectors, each of which has length 2 and is numeric
and has a name in the possible values of y_var. NA within a vector
indicates that the data range should be used. for ggplot2, y_lim is only
used to exclude values outside that range and is ignored if the data span a
narrower range}
}
\description{
Plots modeled values as lines, observed values as points
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
mm <- metab_night(specs(mm_name('night')), data=data_metab('10', day_start=12, day_end=36))
plot_metab_preds(predict_metab(mm))
}
