\title{Return the data types that may be used by metab_models using the 
metab_model_interface.}
\usage{
mm_data(..., optional = "none")
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{column names to select, as passed to \code{\link[dplyr]{select}}}

\item{optional}{one or more character strings listing the columns, if any, 
that may be excluded. If 'all', the entire data.frame may be omitted. If 
'none', the entire data.frame must be included as prototyped. If specific 
column names are given, those columns may be omitted entirely or passed to 
\code{\link{metab}()} as all NAs.}
}
\value{
data data.frame with columns as in the description
}
\description{
Produces a unitted data.frame with the column names, units, and 
  data format to be used by metab_models that comply strictly with the 
  metab_model_interface. These are the columns that may be included:
  
  \itemize{
  
  \item{ \code{solar.time} date-time values in mean solar time (see 
  \code{\link{convert_UTC_to_solartime}}), in POSIXct format with a nominal 
  time zone of UTC. May be approximated by local, non-daylight-savings clock 
  time (still with nominal UTC timezone but with clock noons close to solar 
  noon), but mean solar time is better for matching model time windows to the
  diel cycle of light availability. Throughout this package, variables named 
  "solar.time" are mean solar time, "app.solar.time" means apparent solar 
  time, and "any.solar.time" means either.}
  
  \item{ \code{DO.obs} dissolved oxygen concentration observations, \eqn{mg 
  O[2] L^{-1}}{mg O2 / L}}
  
  \item{ \code{DO.sat} dissolved oxygen concentrations if the water were at 
  equilibrium saturation \eqn{mg O[2] L^{-1}}{mg O2 / L}. Calculate using 
  \link{calc_DO_at_sat}}
  
  \item{ \code{depth} stream depth, \eqn{m}{m}}.
  
  \item{ \code{temp.water} water temperature, \eqn{degC}}.
  
  \item{ \code{light} photosynthetically active radiation, \eqn{\mu mol\ 
  m^{-2} s^{-1}}{micro mols / m^2 / s}}
  
  \item{ \code{date} dates of interest in Date format}
  
  \item{ \code{DO.obs} dissolved oxygen concentration observations, \eqn{mg 
  O[2] L^{-1}}{mg O2 / L}}
  
  \item{ \code{GPP} daily estimates of GPP, \eqn{g O[2] m^-2 d^-1}}
  
  \item{ \code{ER} daily estimates of ER, \eqn{g O[2] m^-2 d^-1}}
  
  \item{ \code{K600} daily estimates of K600, \eqn{d^-1}}
  
  \item{ \code{discharge.daily} daily mean river discharge, \eqn{m^3 s^-1}}
  
  \item{ \code{velocity.daily} daily mean river flow velocity, \eqn{m s^-1}}
  
  }
}
\details{
Most models will require a subset of these data columns. Specialized
  models may deviate from this format, but this is discouraged.

# all possible columns
