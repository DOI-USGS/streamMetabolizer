\title{A prototype for the model_fun argument to mm_model_by_ply}
\usage{
mm_model_by_ply_prototype(data_ply = v(mm_data(NULL)),
  data_daily_ply = v(mm_data(NULL)), day_start = NA, day_end = NA,
  ply_date = NA, ply_validity = NA, timestep_days = NA, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_ply}{a data.frame containing all relevant, validated modeling data
for a single ply of data. (1 ply ~= 1 date, although the day length has 
been specified by day_start and day_end and may not be exactly 24 hours)}

\item{data_daily_ply}{NULL or a data.frame containing inputs with a daily 
timestep.}

\item{day_start}{start time (inclusive) of a day's data in number of hours 
from the midnight that begins the date. For example, day_start=-1.5 
indicates that data describing 2006-06-26 begin at 2006-06-25 22:30, or at 
the first observation time that occurs after that time if day_start doesn't
fall exactly on an observation time.}

\item{day_end}{end time (exclusive) of a day's data in number of hours from 
the midnight that begins the date. For example, day_end=30 indicates that 
data describing 2006-06-26 end at the last observation time that occurs 
before 2006-06-27 06:00.}

\item{ply_date}{the modal date of this ply of data and data_daily, and the 
date by which this ply should be referred topresent.}

\item{ply_validity}{the output of \code{mm_is_valid_day} as applied to this 
data_ply for those tests specified in \code{day_tests}. Those tests will 
have been run before this function is called. The result is TRUE if the ply
is entirely valid, or a character vector containing one or more error 
messages if any tests failed.}

\item{timestep_days}{numeric length of the mean timestep for this day, if 
requested by setting \code{timestep_days} to \code{TRUE} or a numeric value
in the call to \code{\link{mm_model_by_ply}}}

\item{...}{other args that were passed untouched from the function calling 
mm_model_by_ply, through mm_model_by_ply, and finally to this function.}
}
\description{
This function does nothing but has the proper form for a model_fun passed to 
\code{\link{mm_model_by_ply}} Other functions to be used as model_fun may 
call inheritParams to use the parameter definitions given here.
