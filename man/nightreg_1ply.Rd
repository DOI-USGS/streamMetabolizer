\usage{
nightreg_1ply(data_ply, data_daily_ply, day_start, day_end, ply_date, ...,
  night_tests = TRUE, specs = specs("n_np_pi_eu_.lm"))
}
\arguments{
\item{data_ply}{a data.frame containing all relevant, validated modeling data
for a single ply of data. (1 ply ~= 1 date, although the day length has 
been specified by day_start and day_end and may not be exactly 24 hours)}

\item{data_daily_ply}{NULL or a data.frame containing inputs with a daily 
timestep.}

\item{day_start}{start time (inclusive) of a day's data in number of hours 
from the midnight that begins the date. For example, day_start=-1.5 
indicates that data describing 2006-06-26 begin at 2006-06-25 22:30, or at 
the first observation time that occurs after that time if day_start doesn't
fall exactly on an observation time.}

\item{day_end}{end time (exclusive) of a day's data in number of hours from 
the midnight that begins the date. For example, day_end=30 indicates that 
data describing 2006-06-26 end at the last observation time that occurs 
before 2006-06-27 06:00.}

\item{ply_date}{the modal date of this ply of data and data_daily, and the 
date by which this ply should be referred topresent.}

\item{...}{other args that were passed untouched from the function calling 
mm_model_by_ply, through mm_model_by_ply, and finally to this function.}

\item{night_tests}{character vector of validity tests to conduct on the data 
after subsetting to just nighttime}

\item{specs}{a list of model specifications and parameters for a model. 
Although this may be specified manually (it's just a list), it is easier
and safer to use \code{\link{specs}} to generate the list, because the set
of required parameters and their defaults depends on the model given in the
\code{model_name} argument to \code{specs}. The help file for 
\code{\link{specs}} lists the necessary parameters, describes them in 
detail, and gives default values.}
